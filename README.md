### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics required to complete all the features and even stretch features were all covered in lectures and labs. The multiple part weather lab was very useful for learning react and understanding complex topics like conditional rendering, useState, and useEffect. While the git lectures and lab were not incredibly useful for this project, I can see how they will be useful in the coming capstone project.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I would have improved certain website styling. In particular, the modal is very plain. My vision for it is something like the Netflix modals, which play the trailer behind the information. I would also like to implement the recommended page based on a user's watched and bookmarked movies.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I felt much more comfortable in my demo for this project compared to others. I attribute this to creating my presentation further ahead of time and going first. This enabled me to feel more prepared to speak on my project to others.
